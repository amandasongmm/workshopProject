% pre-generated.
% gradFlag indicates whether the gradient of X should be set to 0 or not
% if features handcrafted, X should not be updated, gradient(x) = 0
% otherwise, when feature is chosen randomly, we want to learn the feature 
% by collaborative filtering, it is set to be the corresponding gradient.
